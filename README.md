# Water Buffalo Ping Pong

This is a classic pong game from the 70's, except that you have a water buffalo that's bouncing around instead of a ball.

Features:
- Power-ups and power-downs (which look the same, you're better off not catching any of them)
- Epic game winning screen after reaching 100% progress (20 points)
- A Water Buffalo. He's cute. üêÉ

Controls:
- A/D to move the racket (Log) left/right
- Space to pause the game
- Escape to close the game
